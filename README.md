### Meetup Event Planner (Just form)

### DEMO

### Tested browsers
- Google Chrome Version 46.0.2490.86 (64-bit)
- Safari Version 9.0.1 (11601.2.7.2)

### Notes
- For date/time, I decided to use Bootstrap 3 Datepicker for all instead of using native 'datetime-local' for Chrome browser since the native one's UI is hard for desktop users to select the time (not good user experience)

### Todo
